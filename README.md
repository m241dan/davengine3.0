#Davengine 3.0
A Mud Engine written in Lua by Daniel R. Koris

This is a third version of the always-in-development Davengine Mud Engine. This Engine is born out of the pairing of two my passions: Muds and Lua.

#Engine Concepts
The Engine is an event driven TCP server with the goal of sending visually impaired friendly text outputs OR ascetically pleasing and advanced text outputs to standard telnet clients,x and their improved counter parts.
