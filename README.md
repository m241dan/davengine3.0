#Davengine 3.0
A Mud Engine written in Lua by Daniel R. Koris

This is a third version of the always-in-development Davengine Mud Engine. This Engine is born out of the pairing of two my passions: Muds and Lua.

#Engine Concepts
The Engine is an event driven TCP server with the goal of sending visually impaired friendly text outputs OR ascetically pleasing and advanced text outputs to standard telnet clients, and their improved counter parts. 

#Installation

This is setup to run as just a simple Lua script with all the libs included...

HOWEVER: For those running this on Ubuntu 14.04, you may need to compile your own [time.so](https://github.com/m241dan/lua-time) and [lfs.so](https://github.com/keplerproject/luafilesystem).
